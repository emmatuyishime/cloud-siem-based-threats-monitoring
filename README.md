# Project Overview

Cloud environments introduce new cybersecurity challenges due to their
dynamic, distributed, and multi‑tenant nature, making security
monitoring more complex than traditional infrastructures.

This project demonstrates how a cloud‑native SIEM platform can be
deployed to collect, correlate, and analyze security events in order to
detect potential threats in real time.

The implemented architecture enables:

-   Continuous monitoring of cloud infrastructure
-   Automated threat detection
-   Security event correlation
-   Incident investigation and response
-   Compliance monitoring
